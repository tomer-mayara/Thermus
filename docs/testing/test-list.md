## Unit

**MCP Server**

[V] Connects to the MCP server and runs server/discover; advertises protocol 2026-07-28 and the magumagu identity (`test/unit/mcp/discovery.test.ts`)
[] Every tool call is logged (with the user name)
[] Lists one tool, fetchURLAsMarkdown(url), with its URL input schema
[] Calls the fetcher with the requested URL, passes fetched HTML and the final URL to the pipeline, and returns the pipeline's Markdown
[] Rejects an unknown tool or missing, malformed, or unsupported URL input without calling the fetcher or pipeline
[] Returns a tool error when the fetcher fails, skips the pipeline, and returns no partial Markdown
[] Returns a tool error when the pipeline fails and returns no partial Markdown
[] Closes the transport and cancels pending requests when the server closes; repeated close calls succeed
[] Keeps request state separate between connections

Planned tool tests use test doubles at the fetcher and pipeline public interfaces. They do not run the renderer or the real pipeline.

**Authentication**

HTTP request tests use IdentityVerifierMock from `test/unit/mcp/fixtures/identity-verifier-mock.ts`. It implements our IdentityVerifier contract, supplies configured token claims or errors, and rejects unknown tokens. MCPServer adapts that contract to the SDK's OAuthTokenVerifier. Tests use the real SDK middleware and test doubles for downstream packages.

[V] Maps IdentityVerifier claims to SDK auth information, supplies the original token, and keeps changes to SDK scopes separate from verifier claims (`test/unit/mcp/identity-verifier-sdk-adapter.test.ts`)
[V] IdentityVerifierMock rejects unknown tokens and keeps verification call records separate between instances (`test/unit/mcp/identity-verifier-sdk-adapter.test.ts`)
[V] Requires a Bearer token for server/discover, tools/list, and tools/call; missing tokens return HTTP 401 with a Bearer challenge and the protected-resource metadata URL (`test/unit/mcp/auth.test.ts`)
[V] Rejects a missing Authorization header with HTTP 401 before token verification or MCP dispatch (`test/unit/mcp/auth.test.ts`)
[V] Rejects a malformed Authorization header with HTTP 401 before token verification or MCP dispatch (`test/unit/mcp/auth.test.ts`)
[V] Returns HTTP 401 with invalid_token when the verifier rejects a token (`test/unit/mcp/auth.test.ts`)
[V] Returns HTTP 401 with invalid_token for an expired token or a token with no expiration time (`test/unit/mcp/auth-claims.test.ts`)
[V] Returns HTTP 401 with invalid_token when the verified token audience does not match the MCP resource (`test/unit/mcp/auth-claims.test.ts`)
[V] Returns HTTP 403 with insufficient_scope and the required scope in the Bearer challenge when a verified token lacks permission (`test/unit/mcp/auth-claims.test.ts`)
[] Allows a token for the MCP resource with a future expiration and all required scopes to reach the requested MCP operation
[] Serves protected-resource metadata without a token; identifies the MCP resource, trusted authorization server, and supported scopes, without allowing anonymous tool access
[] Supplies the verified user and tenant context to the tool handler; request headers and tool arguments cannot replace that context
[] Rejects token details that cannot establish the required user or tenant context
[] Keeps user and tenant context separate for sequential and concurrent requests
[] Checks every request again; a valid request does not authorize a later request with a missing or rejected token
[] Stops before MCP dispatch, the fetcher, and the pipeline after any authentication or scope failure
[] Returns a server error if token verification fails unexpectedly; performs no MCP dispatch and exposes no token or internal error details

Real issuer, signature, and key rotation checks belong in authentication interface tests. Browser OAuth flows and Google or Okta compatibility need separate integration and acceptance tests. A fake verifier does not prove those behaviors.

**Audit Trail**

[] Support OTLP protocol
[] Generate a user token we can use in audit trail

**Console logger** (`test/unit/logging/console-logger.test.ts`)

### Planned Cache Key Tests

No cache key helper exists yet. The required unit test inputs and expected results are listed in the [planned cache key design](../design/cache-design.md#required-key-tests). All cases are pending. Do not mark them executed until the helper is implemented and each test passes after a RED → GREEN run.

## Interface

The unit suite runs without an installed renderer or public network access:

```bash
pnpm test:unit
```

Use the pinned runtime for the local renderer interface tests. [Runtime setup](../lightpanda-runtime.md#verify-rendering) gives the checksum recipe and separate local fixture and public-site smoke commands. The controlled local interface suite passed 27 tests with Lightpanda 1.0.0 on macOS ARM64 for this change. Other platform binaries were not exercised. The public-site smoke tests remain a separate check.

## Acceptance

**Small-text cutoff** (`test/acceptance/small-text-cutoff.test.ts`)

[V] Given 11px, 12px, and 13px text, keeps only text at or above the default 12px cutoff in final Markdown and reports one removal with `hidden-html`

Run these tests separately; `npm run check` does not select the acceptance or interface directories:

```sh
npm run build && node --test dist/test/acceptance/emoji-joiners.test.js dist/test/acceptance/literal-inline-emoji-joiners.test.js dist/test/interface/defuddle-emoji-joiners.test.js
```

**Pipeline counters** (`test/acceptance/pipeline-counters.test.ts`)

[V] Given ads, hidden siblings, a comment, encoded controls, and unsupported ad work, returns separate removal and unsupported-attempt counts with unique detection categories; repeated sanitizer and converter stages preserve the counts and input metadata

Run this acceptance test separately; `npm run check` does not select the acceptance directory:

```sh
npm run build && node --test dist/test/acceptance/pipeline-counters.test.js
```

[V] Rejects malformed deferred function headers, reserved variable names, and empty attribute namespace prefixes
[V] Keeps valid deferred values unknown, including nested and empty fallbacks, escaped names, and typed attributes
[V] Keeps native control text under zero-font parents unless an effective author font rule hides it
[V] Keeps a visible table formatting copy when copies with the same parent and source have conflicting styles
[V] Uses ASCII case matching for input types and treats a Unicode lookalike as an invalid text type
[V] Applies a collapsed transform to the blockified HTML root and keeps its visible identity controls
[V] Keeps a visible button label when display:contents removes its box
[V] Flattens preserved 3D contexts for content-visibility:auto, respects class, reset, and important declarations, and keeps deferred grouping unknown
[V] Applies deferred class font and transform replacements and class unitless font sizes in each parser mode
[V] Applies overflow axis grouping, shorthand resets, and important declarations from class rules
[V] Keeps finite composed transforms when binary rounding makes distinct projected columns equal

[V] Keeps zero-font input elements with missing or empty values and reports no hidden payload
[V] Keeps visible axes after numeric cancellation in local and preserved matrix compositions, including unknown exact proof
[V] Ignores transforms on inline and run-in flow list items and applies them to atomic inline flow-root list items

[V] Keeps descendants that invert near-zero flat scales, including intermediate wrappers and near-edge-on rotations
[V] Accumulates flat parent and child transforms while retaining true edge-on flat collapse
[V] Applies known singular transforms to roots with inherited or deferred display and keeps identity controls
[V] Keeps restored child planes through unresolved contents boundaries and ignores a contents wrapper's own transform
[V] Keeps deferred overflow axes unknown, respects longhand order and importance, and retains confirmed flattening controls
[V] Removes exact zero scales with supported scalar calc wrappers and keeps deferred and compound math unknown
[V] Applies transforms to default native control and fieldset boxes, with explicit display and native font controls
[V] Rejects known invalid math siblings before singularity proof and cascade selection, with source-order and important controls
[V] Keeps projective coefficients unknown when they underflow or round to an affine row
[V] Preserves inherited local state through exact identity lists at unknown box boundaries while keeping child planes unknown
[V] Removes edge-on text and images after in-plane rotations while keeping restored planes and exact nonzero matrix controls
[V] Keeps matrix offsets unresolved when the authored linear part only rounds to a pure translation
[V] Keeps visible text and images after local and inherited offset cancellation or overflow, including embedded CSS and contents wrappers
[V] Requires proven zero ancestor offsets before a relative-unit fallback and retains actual offscreen and restored-child controls
[V] Applies offset error bounds through the independent public hidden-element check

**Build output** (`test/unit/build-output.test.ts`, `pnpm test:build`)

[V] All test commands exclude output from renamed and deleted tests
[V] Unit and interface commands keep their suite selection
[V] Fresh and stale-output fixture tests produce the same current test names, complete emitted file set, and file bytes, including test source maps
[V] Repeated builds remove deleted production modules and source maps
[V] Builds preserve source and files outside the owned output when called from another directory
[V] Builds reject symlink and regular-file output paths without deleting their data
[V] Typecheck does not emit files or clear existing output
