## Unit

**Renderer network policy**

[V] Rejects blocked IPv4 and IPv6 ranges, obfuscated loopback addresses, mixed DNS answers, and failed DNS before renderer launch
[V] Accepts public addresses and checks every DNS answer again on each fetch

[V] Preserves the next list item and its attributes when an ad item omits its end tag
[V] Preserves following elements after omitted paragraph end tags inside list items and before dialog, search, menu, and hgroup
[V] Preserves a table after an ad paragraph with an omitted end tag in a fragment without an explicit html element or doctype
[V] Preserves non-ad tables between reconstructed formatting matches and counts overlapping selectors per DOM node
[V] Removes an explicit ad body that reaches end of source, with and without a doctype

[V] Reports exfil-shaped URLs and keeps them in the HTML

**Supported CSS Visibility Rules**

[V] Applies inline and eligible local style rules after the default sanitizer pass

[V] Keeps hidden title and link attributes removed when text ends at the same source offset as a reconstructed tag
[V] Checks CSS-hidden content formed by a previous removal and keeps visible inline overrides
[V] Preserves visible text after parser-created formatting copies without source locations
[V] Removes hidden content from parser-created copies without source locations
[V] Preserves unrelated attributes on reconstructed source tags
[V] Decodes escaped attribute selector `i` and `s` flags
[V] Uses ASCII-only case folding for the attribute selector `i` flag
[V] Uses default ASCII-insensitive matching for `rel` and honors its `s` flag

[V] Matches escaped nonbreaking spaces in class names and accepts escaped leading digits in ID selectors
[V] Treats an escaped `*` as a type name and does not fetch linked stylesheets
[V] Rejects a selector list with invalid ID or attribute selector forms, while accepting an escaped leading digit
[V] Rejects a whole rule when its selector list has an unsupported selector
[V] Skips pseudo selectors, namespace selectors, invalid selector forms, and inactive media rules
[V] Rejects selector matching when a selector or document exceeds its stated complexity budget
[V] Rejects over-budget documents without returning partial HTML or Markdown
[V] Handles uppercase and escaped units and function names
[V] Keeps visible text for invalid declarations, malformed escaped values, and unresolved variables
[V] Keeps same-color text visible when its background image is unresolved
[V] Preserves visible text, unrelated attributes, and Layer 1 findings

[V] Does not fetch linked stylesheets or CSS imports
[V] Limits output growth from a selected shared background image while preserving visible Markdown text

[V] Propagates a step error without calling the next step
[V] Does not mutate the input context
[V] Preserves sanitizer findings and warnings through Markdown conversion
[V] Rejects oversized HTML before Markdown conversion
[V] Removes hidden payload after an ad with an omitted paragraph end tag and keeps following visible text

**HTML to MD**

[V] Converts surviving HTML text to Markdown

[V] Returns Markdown instead of raw HTML
[V] Returns empty output for a document with an empty body
[V] Returns empty Markdown and preserves findings when cleaning leaves empty or whitespace-only HTML
[V] Preserves URL, HTML, and existing counts in a new context without mutating the input
[V] Extracts the document title
[V] Makes no network requests for preferred async site extractors when the document has content

[V] Preserves local content and resolves relative links with finalUrl
[V] Resolves relative, root-relative, and protocol-relative links after same-host and cross-host redirects
[V] Applies ad rules for the final host after redirects, in both host-change directions
[V] Preserves direct content when requestedUrl and finalUrl match

**HTML Fetcher**

[V] Returns requestedUrl, finalUrl, and HTML for direct and redirected fetches

[V] Rejects missing or invalid fetch metadata

## Interface

**Renderer network policy**

[V] Blocks literal and DNS loopback targets before a connection
[V] Blocks a DNS change, IPv6 loopback, a redirect, a script resource, fetch, XHR, and WebSocket to a blocked address
[V] Allows an IPv4 loopback fixture only inside the test scope and ignores proxy environment settings
