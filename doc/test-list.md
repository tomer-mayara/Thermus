### Planned Cache Key Tests

No cache key helper exists yet. The required unit test inputs and expected results are listed in the [planned cache key design](../docs/cache-design.md#required-key-tests). All cases are pending. Do not mark them executed until the helper is implemented and each test passes after a RED → GREEN run.

## Interface

**Renderer network policy**

**HTML Fetcher**

The unit suite runs without an installed renderer or public network access:

```bash
pnpm test:unit
```

Use the pinned runtime for the local renderer interface tests. [Runtime setup](../docs/lightpanda-runtime.md#verify-rendering) gives the checksum recipe and separate local fixture and public-site smoke commands. The controlled local interface suite passed 27 tests with Lightpanda 1.0.0 on macOS ARM64 for this change. Other platform binaries were not exercised. The public-site smoke tests remain a separate check.

[V] Returns the completed asynchronous DOM after its 500 ms request delay, before the full wait budget
[V] Rejects when overlapping requests prevent network idle, kills the child at five seconds, waits for child completion, and returns no partial HTML
